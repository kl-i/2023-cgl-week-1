  In this talk, I give a statement of the
  ``Galois to automorphic'' direction of categorical geometric Langlands.
  I will describe the Galois and automorphic side, 
  the Hecke action on both sides, and the definition of
  Hecke eigensheaves.
  On the way, I hope to give motivation for the
  various objects at play : 
  the stack of $G^L$ local systems on the fixed curve $X$,
  the stack of $G$ bundles on $X$, $D$-modules,
  arc groups, loop groups, the affine Grassmannian,
  and geometric Satake.
